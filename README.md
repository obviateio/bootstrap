# SGN's Bootstrapping Utility

## What is this?
As I install and re-install machines (which happens regularly), I try and
 document the steps I take. Partially this is so that I can repeat the
 proccess next time and partially to I can keep my tweaks and preferences.
 As I make more changes and updates to my machine, I try to update this
 setup.

It's very customized to my software and my preferences. I doubt anyone
 will want to use these scripts exactly as they are. But fork them, adapt
 them, use them as a base. Whatever you want!

## How to use:
 * Clone the git repo to your computer
 * Execute ./run.sh
 * Enjoy!
